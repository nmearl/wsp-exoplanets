Exoplanets are an exciting topic in astronomy and astrophysics. An explosion of distant worlds have been discovered in the last decade, aided by advanced telescopes and broader scientific surveys. How we analyze and learn about exoplanets is complicated by the fact that we don't "see" them -- instead, we infer their presence by the effect they have on their parent star. By analyzing the light we receive, we can discern their radius, mass, eccentricity, and other necessary characteristics that let us figure out the composition and behavior of these distant worlds.

In this project, we'll learn more about exoplanets and the influence they have on the observations we make. By developing a theoretical understanding for how we expect the behavior of observed light curves to change depending on the physical characteristics of these exoplanets, we'll be able to make a simple model that allows us to analyze any light curve and discover the nature of these far-off worlds.
