# What is a planet?

In ancient times, all you had to do was look up at the night sky at all the fixed points of light (stars), and notice that over the course of days and months, some of these points of light moved across. The Greeks called them *planetai* ($\pi \lambda \alpha \nu \eta \tau \iota$) or what translates to "wanderers" among the stars. There were five of them that could be seen with the naked eye, which we know today as Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn (more on how other planets were discovered later). When many of us were growing up, it is likely that we were told there were nine planets in our solar system (today we have eight -- we don't consider Pluto a planet anymore). But ever since Galileo pointed his telescope upwards at the sky and discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter, humans haven't stopped looking, and we've gotten pretty good at finding other "worlds" in our solar system, and indeed, outside of it. Planets that have discovered outside of our solar system are called extrasolar planets, or "__exoplanets__".

:class: tip
How many exoplanets do you think we have discovered so far?

````{dropdown} Confirmed Exoplanets
The first confirmed detection of an exoplanet was in 1992. As of May 2020, there are 4,158 confirmed exoplanets with thousands of additional candidates. The gif below should give you a sense of how many different planetary __systems__ are out there, in just a small patch of sky.

```{admonition} Question 2
:class: tip
How do we detect them all? Try to come up with some ideas (as many as you can think of!) as to how we are able to discover so many exoplanets. Discuss these with your group. Under what conditions would these methods be viable?
