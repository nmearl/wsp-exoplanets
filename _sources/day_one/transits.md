# Transits

In astronomy, a __transit__ is defined as the passage of one celestial object in front of another, partially blocking it from view. Such phenomena can be observed within our own solar system. For instance, from Earth, transits of Mercury and Venus across the face of the Sun may occasionally be seen. Mercury’s transits occur roughly once every seven years, while on Venus, pairs of transits occur eight years apart, with separations of 121 years and 105 years between pairs. Below is an image of the transit of Venus as seen by the Solar Dynamics Observatory on 5 June 2012.

Another type of transit that is observable from Earth are transits of extrasolar planets (exoplanets) in front of their host stars. Transits of exoplanets are one way in which such objects can be discovered. As a planet passes in front of its host star, it blocks a certain amount of the light emitted from the star from reaching the Earth, causing the star to appear to dim slightly. This dimming effect occurs once per revolution of the planet about its host star.  The time it takes for a planet to make one complete orbit around its star is called an orbital period.  The Earth’s orbital period is defined as 1 year. Plots of stellar brightness measurements versus time, known as __light curves__, are used to hunt for planets.

Sketch what you imagine a plot of stellar brightness versus time for a star with a transiting exoplanet might look like.

````{dropdown} Visualizing Exoplanet Transits
Below is a visualization of an exoplanet transit (only viewable on the computer). Note how the brightness of the star dips as the planet passes in front of it, reaching its minimum when the planet is fully in front of the star. Of course, the light curve below only shows a single transit of the planet. If the time scale were elongated such that it included many complete orbits of the planet, the plot would include many dips like the one shown below with equal spacing between them.

```{admonition} Question 4
:class: tip
Light curves of stars with transiting exoplanets contain a wealth of information about the exoplanets. What information do you think can be gathered from analysis of a light curve? How? Hint: Look at the light curve from the GIF above and consider what information the transit depth and separation between dips might give you.

```{admonition} Question 5
:class: tip
Imagine there are two planets orbiting around identical stars. One planet’s period is twice as long as the other. Both planets are the same size. Sketch light curves for both planets. What is the same about each light curve? What is different? (Note: absolute precision is not necessary for your light curves; we’re just looking at the comparison between the two.)
```

```{admonition} Question 6
:class: tip
Again, imagine there are two planets orbiting around identical stars. This time, one planet’s radius is twice as large as the other. Both planets have the same period. What is the same about each light curve? What is different?

```{admonition} Question 7
:class: tip
Click on the following link, which will bring you to an exoplanet transit simulator applet: http://astro.unl.edu/naap/esp/animations/transitSimulator.html (Make sure to have Flash enabled in your browser.)

Note: Flux is the total energy emitted by the star that reaches each unit area of a detector (such as your eyes) every second. Normalized flux means that the flux received from the star has been multiplied by some factor so that the maximum flux (the flux from the star it is not being transited by the planet) is equal to 1. You can think of the y-axis as a fraction telling you how much of the star’s total flux is reaching the Earth at a given moment in time.

- Take some time to play with the applet: try out different presets, play around with different parameters, etc. Discuss how the following parameters affect the observed light curve: planet radius, orbital distance (semimajor axis), eccentricity (deviation from a circular orbit), mass of planet, mass of star, and inclination of system (tilted-ness of the orbit relative to the equator of the star).    
- Uncheck “show theoretical curve” and check “show simulated measurements”. As the command implies, this will show simulations of measurements taken with telescopes of stellar brightness over time, just as you might see when looking at real data. You might also want to decrease the noise level a bit (say to the halfway mark) and increase the number of measurements. Continue to play around a bit with the parameter settings. What types of planets are easiest to detect? What types of planets are most difficult to detect? How does the mass of the star affect the ease of detectability of the planet?
