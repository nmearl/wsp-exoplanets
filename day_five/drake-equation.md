# The Drake Equation and the Fermi Paradox

In 1961, radio astronomer Frank Drake came up with a probabilistic argument in an attempt to answer the popular question of how many intelligent alien civilizations might exist in our galaxy. It was in part an estimate informed by his scientific training, and partly by observations of human nature and how/if those might apply to other potential civilizations. His equation looked something like this:

$N = R_* ~\times~ f_p ~\times~ n_e ~\times~ f_l ~\times~ f_i ~\times~ f_c ~\times~ L $

where 

* $N$   = The number of civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy whose electromagnetic emissions are detectable.

* $R_*$ = The rate of formation of stars suitable for the development of intelligent life.

* $f_p$ = The fraction of those stars with planetary systems.

* $n_e$ = The number of planets, per solar system, with an environment suitable for life.

* $f_l$ = The fraction of suitable planets on which life actually appears.

* $f_i$ = The fraction of life bearing planets on which intelligent life emerges.

* $f_c$ = The fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space.

* $L$ = The length of time such civilizations release detectable signals into space.


**Stop** here to discuss this equation and come up with our own estimate of how many civilizations are detectable.

```{dropdown} Values Used by Drake
The following were the values used by Drake:

* $R_*$ = 10
* $f_p$ = 0.5
* $n_e$ = 2.0
* $f_l$ = 1.0
* $f_i$ = 0.01 
* $f_c$ = 0.01
* $L$ = 10000
```

```{admonition} Question 1
What does this equal, and how does this compare to your estimate?
```

If we expect there to be at least a handful of technologoically-advanced, detectable civilizations in our galaxy, think about how many more there should be in the hundred billion galaxies that exist in only the *observable* universe. And yet, we haven't encountered a single one of them. What gives? This is the Nobel prize-winning physicist Enrico Fermi pondered, in what has famously come to be known as the **Fermi Paradox**. (Click here for an excellent read on *why* it's possible that we haven't seen or heard of aliens yet: https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html)

```{admonition} Question 2
Why do you think we haven't picked up on any signals from or been visited by aliens yet?
